Hello, my name is Nallala Sanjay, and I am presenting my project: 
AI-Powered Communication Assistant for managing customer support emails.

This assistant was built to automatically filter, analyze, and generate 
responses to customer emails, helping support teams save time and improve 
customer satisfaction.

Step 1: Email Retrieval and Filtering
- The system retrieves emails from a dataset or directly from email accounts.
- It filters subjects containing words like "Support", "Query", "Request", or "Help".
- On the dashboard, we can see sender, subject, body, and date for all filtered emails.

Step 2: Categorization and Prioritization
- Each email is analyzed for sentiment (Positive, Neutral, or Negative).
- Priority is assigned based on urgency keywords such as "urgent", "critical", or "immediately".
- Urgent emails are pushed to the top of the processing queue.

Step 3: Context-Aware Auto-Responses
- The system generates professional draft replies.
- Replies adapt based on sentiment and urgency. For example:
   - Negative emails get empathetic responses.
   - Urgent emails get quick acknowledgments and priority actions.
- Drafts are editable before sending.

Step 4: Information Extraction
- The system extracts contact information such as phone numbers or alternate emails.
- It also identifies product or feature references mentioned in the email.
- This extra metadata helps support teams act faster.

Step 5: Dashboard and Analytics
- The Streamlit dashboard displays:
   - All filtered support emails
   - Sentiment and priority statistics (shown in charts)
   - Metrics like emails received in the last 24 hours, resolved vs pending
- Users can mark emails as resolved directly from the dashboard.

Impact:
- This project reduces manual effort, ensures faster and empathetic responses,
  and improves customer satisfaction.

Thank you for watching this demo. 
The full code, dataset, and instructions are available in the GitHub repository.
